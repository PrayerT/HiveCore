## 🌐 Overview

**HiveCore** is an open-source extension framework for **AgentScope (AS)** — aiming to **complete** the AS ecosystem with enhanced runtime management, sandbox orchestration, and memory coordination.

It provides a unified infrastructure to run, observe, and extend AS Agents dynamically.  
The name “HiveCore” reflects its design principle: *many agents, one hive — a collective intelligence system.*

---

## 🚀 Vision

> *From isolated Agents to orchestrated intelligence.*

While AgentScope provides a foundation for agent definitions and communication, **HiveCore** focuses on what’s missing in AS:
- 🧩 **Dynamic Runtime Management** — isolated sandbox per Agent  
- 🔄 **Multi-Agent Orchestration** — role-based coordination and scheduling  
- 🧠 **Memory & Context Persistence** — Memu/Mem0-like hybrid memory layer  
- 🧱 **Extensible Plugin System** — allows community modules to hook into the runtime  

The long-term goal: **make AgentScope a complete, self-evolving agent runtime standard.**

  Project -->|round delivery snapshot| Planner
  Planner -->|>= 90%?<br/>Auto QA| AA

  AA -->|ship final deliverable| User
```

HiveCore layers (AA, planner/evaluator, project context, MsgHub) sit on top of AgentScope’s core agent abstractions and message channels, letting us keep AS compatibility while adding persistent assistants and project-scoped collaboration.

---

## 🔁 User Flow

1. **AssistantAgent (AA) exists per user** — it is outside any single project and stores long-term memory, a dedicated prompt, and a personal knowledge base.  
2. **Project creation seeds shared context** — every project gets its own memory store, knowledge base, and `MsgHub` broadcast pool so new agents always know the latest progress.  
3. **AA ↔ user refinement loop** — AA co-edits requirements and delivery criteria with the user; once approved, the planner pulls suitable roles from the AgentScope agent library to form the execution team.  
4. **Round-based work & gating** — after each batch, outputs are aggregated into a “round delivery.” AA checks against the acceptance bar (default ≥90%); if not met, the planner regenerates the plan and can swap or add agents for the next loop.  
5. **Delivery matches the artifact** — websites get deployed with URLs returned, media assets are provided as files; AA stays accountable for “what you ask is what you receive.”

## ⚙️ Capabilities: AgentScope vs HiveCore

| Capability | AgentScope Native | HiveCore Customization |
|------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Agent abstractions, tool calling, base messaging | ✅ | Uses as foundation |
| AssistantAgent persona with persistent user memory/prompt/KB | — | ✅ |
| Project-level memory, knowledge base, MsgHub broadcast pool | ⚙️ basic data hooks | ✅ enriched orchestration |
| Team planner & delivery evaluator (≥90% gating, replan loop) | — | ✅ |
| Agent library & role templates | ✅ | ✅ extended with domain presets |
| Runtime sandbox orchestration (Docker/Fargate/local) | Limited | ✅ dedicated layer |
| REST/WebSocket control plane | ✅ | ✅ additional endpoints |

## 🏗️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/hivecore.git
cd hivecore
pip install -e .
```

Or from PyPI (coming soon):

```bash
pip install hivecore
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```python
from hivecore import HiveRuntime
from agentscope import Agent

# Load agents
agents = [Agent("coder"), Agent("reviewer")]

# Create runtime
runtime = HiveRuntime(agents)
runtime.run("Build a weather app using React and Django")
```
